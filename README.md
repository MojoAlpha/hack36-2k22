## Introduction:

In all big companies and college/institutions proxy servers are used to provide internet services to people. Generally they provide few ip addresses to connect
Different proxy servers provide different speed depending upon the traffic it gets.
So, some servers may get heavy traffic and provide low speed.
The users try different proxy servers on hit-and-trial basis to get good speed.

We automated this manual process of comparing proxy servers.
We created a desktop app which checks the speed of all provided proxy servers and provides you with the fastest choice to connect.

earlier there was no GUI based proxy management app for linux users.
